Thanks for your interest in our research!

If you have problems running our code, please include

1. Your operating system
2. Your tensorflow version
3. Your python version
4. The stack trace of the error that you see

This is **research code**, and its primary purpose is to reproduce the scientific results that you see in our paper.
If you are looking for ways to extend our work such as 

* handling arbitrary images
* handling videos as input
* using other 2d detectors
* large-scale deployment
* handling missing data
* you want to make a startup out of this code

then pull requests are welcome, but it is very unlikely we will have the time to help you.
